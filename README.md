# To-Do App (Offline-First)

## 📌 Overview
This is a simple and practical To-Do application built using Vanilla JavaScript, designed to work entirely on the client side.  
The app stores data using IndexedDB, allowing tasks to persist even after page refresh or browser restart — without any backend or external API.

This project is intended as a portfolio / learning project, focusing on real-world browser storage and offline-first behavior.
